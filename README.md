# Health Insurance Cross Sell Prediction

Small ML project that aims to predict health insurance owners who will be interested in vehicle insurance based on a <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/anmolkumar/health-insurance-cross-sell-prediction">Kaggle dataset</a>. Utilises NumPy, pandas and scikit-learn tools. Comes with a Web API made with Flask, and a Dockerfile for containerization.

## Problem Statement

An insurance company would like to plan its communication strategy to reach the customers who are willing to purchase Vehicle Insurance. Thus, the company will optimise its business model and revenue. In order to do so, it is highly helpful to predict whether the policyholders of Health Insurance from the past year will also be interested in Vehicle Insurance. The objective is to build a model for making such predictions. The provided data contains information about demographics (gender, age, region), vehicles (vehicle age, vehicle damage), policy (premium, sourcing channel) etc.
